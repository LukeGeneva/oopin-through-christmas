# OOPin' Through Christmas

An object-oriented, test-driven, domain-centric approach to Advent of Code.

See the associated
[post](https://lukegeneva.dev/blog/oopin-through-christmas.html) on my blog for
more information.

Advent of Code asks that we not put puzzle input in repositories. Therefore, it
has been ignored in `.gitignore`. If you're working with this code directly, you
can place your own input files at the root of project in a directory called
`input`. It should following this pattern:

```
input/day1.txt
input/day2.txt
...
```
